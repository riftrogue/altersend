## About

AlterSend is a free, open-source app for sending files directly between your devices — no cloud, no uploads, no size limits. Files transfer peer-to-peer and are end-to-end encrypted; nothing is ever stored on a server.

Why use WeTransfer, Dropbox, or Google Drive when you can send files directly — instantly, privately, with no upload costs and no limits?

## Features

- **No accounts** — no signup, no login, no email address required
- **No servers** — files transfer directly device-to-device, nothing stored in the cloud
- **End-to-end encrypted** — only your devices can read your files, always
- **No file size limit** — send a 100 MB photo or 500 GB video archive, same experience
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android
- **Works everywhere** — local network or across continents, same code path
- **Multi-language** — fully translated UI, available in 12 languages
- **Open source** — Apache-2.0, audit every line yourself

## How it works

1. Open AlterSend on both devices
2. One device shows a **join code** (or QR)
3. The other scans or types it
4. Files transfer directly — peer to peer

```
   ┌─────────┐          encrypted P2P          ┌─────────┐
   │ Device  │ ◄──────────────────────────────► │ Device  │
   │   A     │     direct, no middleman         │   B     │
   └─────────┘                                  └─────────┘
        ▲                                            ▲
        │       peer discovery via Hyperswarm        │
        └────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                   (DHT, no central server)
```

### Under the hood

AlterSend is built on [Hyperswarm](https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperswarm), a Kademlia DHT at its core. Behind those four steps:

1. **A random 32-byte key is generated** for each transfer (`crypto.randomBytes(32)`). That 64-char hex string *is* the join code you share.
2. **Peers rendezvous on a hash of that key, not the key itself.** Both sides compute the same discovery key — a BLAKE2b hash derived from the join code — and join the DHT on that. The raw key never leaves your device, only its hash is published.
3. **Public bootstrap nodes are the only entry point.** A handful of them get peers onto the DHT. After that, no central server is involved — and there's no relay fallback, so if direct hole-punching fails, the connection fails.
4. **The connection is direct and end-to-end encrypted.** Peers connect over a Noise-encrypted socket, and the sender shares its [Hyperdrive](https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperdrive) key over that channel. Files are imported into the sender's local Hyperdrive, replicated to the receiver's, then written out to disk — so in v1 each side needs roughly **2× the transfer size** in free space while a transfer runs. *(Working to improve this.)*

## For developers

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- npm 10+
- Xcode (iOS) or Android Studio (Android)

### Setup

```sh
git clone https://github.com/denislupookov/altersend.git
cd altersend
npm install

cp apps/desktop/.env.example apps/desktop/.env
cp apps/mobile/.env.example apps/mobile/.env
# All env vars are optional in dev — the app runs without them.
```

### Run

```sh
npm run dev            # desktop (Electron)
npm run mobile:start   # mobile (Expo)
```

### Build

```sh
npm run desktop:build  # packages + desktop app
```

Platform installers (`.dmg`, `.exe`, `.AppImage`) are produced by the release CI workflow — trigger manually from the Actions tab.

### Project structure

```
apps/
  desktop/    Electron app — main + renderer + Bare worklet
  mobile/     React Native / Expo app
packages/
  core/       P2P protocol — Hyperswarm, Hyperdrive, RPC
  domain/     State management — Zustand store, business logic
  components/ Cross-platform UI — React Strict DOM + Tailwind
  locales/   Shared locale metadata, i18next setup, and catalogs

See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) for data flow and inter-process boundaries.

### Internationalization

Desktop and mobile share translation catalogs through `@altersend/locales`, currently covering 12 locales. See [docs/i18n.md](docs/i18n.md) for the translation workflow.
