## About

AlterSend is a free, open-source app for sending files directly between your devices — no cloud, no uploads, no size limits. Files transfer peer-to-peer and are end-to-end encrypted; nothing is ever stored on a server.

Why use WeTransfer, Dropbox, or Google Drive when you can send files directly — instantly, privately, with no upload costs and no limits?

## Features

- **No accounts** — no signup, no login, no email address required
- **No cloud storage** — files go directly between devices; nothing is ever uploaded or stored on a server
- **Receive in a browser** — recipients open a share link at [app.altersend.com](https://app.altersend.com) and download straight from the sender, no install
- **End-to-end encrypted** — only your devices can read your files, always
- **No file size limit** — send a 100 MB photo or 500 GB video archive, same experience
- **Pair your devices** — pair a device once, then send to it without scanning or typing a code each time
- **Cross-platform** — macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, Android
- **Works everywhere** — local network or across continents, same code path
- **Multi-language** — fully translated UI, available in 13 languages
- **Open source** — Apache-2.0, audit every line yourself

### macOS Homebrew

You can also install AlterSend on macOS using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew install --cask altersend
```

### Linux Flatpak

You can install AlterSend directly from our Flatpak repository:

```sh
flatpak remote-add --user altersend https://riftrogue.github.io/altersend/riftrogue-altersend.flatpakrepo
flatpak install --user altersend com.altersend.AlterSend
```

### Arch Linux

AlterSend is available in the AUR as two packages: `altersend-bin` for official release binaries and `altersend-git` for the latest Git changes compiled from source.

```sh
yay -S altersend-bin
yay -S altersend-git
```

## How it works

1. Open AlterSend on both devices
2. One device shows a **join code** (or QR)
3. The other scans or types it
4. Files transfer directly — peer to peer

```
   ┌──────────┐                                  ┌──────────┐
   │ Device A │ ◄─── direct, E2E encrypted ────► │ Device B │
   └──────────┘                                  └──────────┘
      │    ▲                                        ▲    │
      │    └───── discovery via Hyperswarm DHT ─────┘    │
      │             (hash of join code only)             │
      │                                                  │
      │            ┌───────────────────────┐             │
      └──────────► │ Relay (fallback only) │ ◄───────────┘
                   │ forwards encrypted    │
                   │ bytes it can't read   │
                   └───────────────────────┘
```

### Under the hood

AlterSend is built on [Hyperswarm](https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperswarm), a Kademlia DHT at its core. Behind those four steps:

1. **A random 32-byte key is generated** for each transfer (`crypto.randomBytes(32)`). That 64-char hex string _is_ the join code you share.
2. **Peers rendezvous on a hash of that key, not the key itself.** Both sides compute the same discovery key — a BLAKE2b hash derived from the join code — and join the DHT on that. The raw key never leaves your device, only its hash is published.
3. **Public bootstrap nodes are the only entry point.** A handful of them get peers onto the DHT. After that, no central server is involved in discovery. Most transfers are direct peer-to-peer; when a direct connection can't be established — usually because both peers are behind symmetric NAT (for example both on a VPN) — the transfer falls back to a **relay** that forwards the already-encrypted stream between them without ever seeing file contents. It's on by default and can be turned off in Settings → Relay.
4. **The connection is end-to-end encrypted.** Peers connect over a Noise-encrypted socket. The sender reads each file straight off disk in chunks and hashes every one with BLAKE2b; the receiver checks the hash and writes the chunk at its offset in the destination file.

**Pair once, skip the code.** You can pair devices you own so future transfers go straight through — no code to scan or type. Pairing only stores a public device key, the secret stays in your OS keychain, and a paired device is recognized without exposing your identity to anyone else. See [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md#remembered-devices--pairing) for the full design.

## For developers

### Prerequisites

### Internationalization

Desktop and mobile share translation catalogs through `@altersend/locales`, currently covering 13 locales. See [docs/i18n.md](docs/i18n.md) for the translation workflow.
